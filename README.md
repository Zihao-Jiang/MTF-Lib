# MTF-Lib
Multiple Target Filtering Library

I am planning to prepare a kind of multi-target filtering library which includes many types multi-target filtering algorithms such as:
1. Traditional multi-target filters such as Global Nearest Neighbour (GNN), Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDAF), Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT), etc.
2. Random Finite Set (RFS)-based multi-target filtering algorithms such as Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter, Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density (CPHD) filter, Cardinality Balanced Multi-Bernoulli (CB-MB) filter, Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter, Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter, etc.
3. Stochastic populations-based filter such as Hypothesized and IndependentStochastic Population (HISP) filter, etc.
4. Multiple target, multiple type filtering algorithm such as N-type PHD filter, etc

I will also include single target filtering in different implementation schemes for quick start such as Kalman filter (KF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), uncented Kalman filter (UKF) and particle filter (PF).

The codes will be uploaded soon!
