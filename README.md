# MTF-Lib
Multiple Target Filtering Library

We are planning to prepare a kind of multi-target filtering library which includes many types multi-target filtering algorithms such as:
1. Traditional multi-target filters such as Global Nearest Neighbour (GNN), Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDAF), Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT), etc.
2. Random Finite Set (RFS)-based multi-target filtering algorithms such as Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter, Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density (CPHD) filter, Cardinality Balanced Multi-Bernoulli (CB-MB) filter, Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter, Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter, etc.
3. Stochastic populations-based filter such as Hypothesized and IndependentStochastic Population (HISP) filter, etc.

The codes will be uploaded soon!
